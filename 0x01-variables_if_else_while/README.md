## PROJECT: 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

### Resources
#### Read or watch:

- Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf
- Keywords and identifiers
- integers
- Arithmetic Operators in C
- If statements in C
- if…else statement
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- while loop in C
- While loop

### Learning Objectives

### General
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- How to use variables with the while loop
- How to print variables using printf
- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

### Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

### Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing:

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

- You can find the source code here
- The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
	The number, followed by
		if the number is greater than 0: is positive
		if the number is 0: is zero
		if the number is less than 0: is negative
	followed by a new line


#### OUTPUT DEMO:

```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-520693284 is negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-973398895 is negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-199220452 is negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
561319348 is positive
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
561319348 is positive
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
266853958 is positive
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-48147767 is negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
0 is zero
